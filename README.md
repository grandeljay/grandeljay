# Hello there :wave:

My name is Jay and I am a PHP and WordPress developer. I love the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) community and try to make, use and contribute to this wonderful ecosystem.

I tend not to use any frameworks like Laraval and Symfony because I like to learn how to build stuff "properly", before relying on the help of frameworks.

Generally I most enjoy working with APIs or building plugins and extending or modifying existing software. Anything with a medium to small scope.

## Projects

As of writing this, I mostly work with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/), [modified-shop](https://www.modified-shop.org/) and plain vanilla [PHP](https://www.php.net/). Check out my stuff!

## Contributing

Pretty much everything I know is self taught and I am lacking many programming paradigms and a good structure when building web apps.

If you are a developer, looking to contribute to any projects, check out:
